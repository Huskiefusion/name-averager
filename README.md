This is the site I used to get my name info. I selected the year to be 2024, selected top 1000 from the dropdown, and used the number of births radio bubble. The CSV file needed to be reformatted quite a bit to be useful. You can see how I changed it if you would like.

It works by applying each method of statistical analysis to each individual letter position in each name relative to the beginning.
This is not terribly useful, just something funny I wanted to do. In case you are curious but can't be bothered here are my findings.
